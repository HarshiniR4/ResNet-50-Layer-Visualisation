# ResNet-50-Layer-Visualisation
Visualise convnets outputs and filters and heatmaps of class activations for ResNet-50 based CNN trained on CIFAR-10 Dataset

## Visualizing heatmaps of class activation in an image. This is useful to understand which part of an image where identified as belonging to a given class, and thus allows to localize objects in images.

## Visualizing intermediate convnet outputs. This is useful to understand how successive convnet layers transform their input.

## visualizing convnets filters. This is useful to understand precisely what visual pattern or concept each filter in a convnet is receptive to.
